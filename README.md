# Nanograms / Picross / Nonograms

A simple clone of the game Nanogram, developed with the T3 Stack.
You may check the game here: https://nanogram.vercel.app/

This application also uses vercel's postgres database and kv for caching. 
To clone and run this application, one has to host the database and kv, with their own choice of provider.
One just need to set the corresponding environment variable with their own connection url.
